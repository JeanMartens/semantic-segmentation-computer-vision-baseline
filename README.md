# Baseline
My deep learning CV semantic segmentation baseline using accelerate for parallel computing.

This repo is made for me to be able to start project and DL competitions fast but feel free to use it if you want to.  

The notebook folder is made for the user to explore his data and so is left blank. The model folder is also a way to store models or checkpoints.
